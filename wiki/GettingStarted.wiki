=== Auto detection ===

With a bit of luck, your ivy-enabled modules will be detected automatically by IvyIDEA. You'll see a popup stating that one or more new facets are detected on opening your project.

Note: it is possible that you missed the popup as it is only displayed briefly. In this case you can still see if a new facet was detected by the presence of a blinking gear icon in the statusbar:

If you click on the 'More...' link, you'll get a screen that looks like this:
