=== Auto detection ===

With a bit of luck, your ivy-enabled modules will be detected automatically by IvyIDEA. You'll see a popup stating that one or more new facets are detected on opening your project.

Note: it is possible that you missed the popup as it is only displayed briefly. In this case you can still see if a new facet was detected by the presence of a blinking gear icon in the statusbar:

If you click on the 'More...' link (or on the blinking gear icon), you'll get a screen that looks like this:

Click 'Edit Settings...' to make sure that the correct ivy.xml file is chosen for each module. This will take you to the Module Settings screen, which is described in greater detail below.
_Note: there is a known issue that the ivy file displayed here may differ from the one that is configured in the module settings, so make sure to check this if your module contains multiple ivy.xml files!_

=== Manual setup ===

If the autodetection did not work for some reason, or you want to changes the settings that were automatically chosen, you can manually setup an IvyIDEA facet for each module that needs it. This can be done by opening the project settings and clicking on the 'Modules' item.

You can add a facet to a module simply by clicking the [+] icon above the module list, or by right clicking on the module name as shown here:

Once the facet is added to the tree, you can change its configuration by clicking on it, you will get the following screen:

Here you need to specify the ivy file for your module. This is the file which holds the dependency information for your module. _More information about ivy files can be found in the [http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/tutorial/start.html apache ivy quick start guide]_

== Project Settings ==

If you do not specify an ivy settings file with your module (meaning that you left the 'Use from project settings' checkbox checked), you obviously need to specify one at the project level. The following screenshot shows you how to do this:
