=== Auto detection ===

With a bit of luck, your ivy-enabled modules will be detected automatically by IvyIDEA. You'll see a popup stating that one or more new facets are detected on opening your project.

Note: it is possible that you missed the popup as it is only displayed briefly. In this case you can still see if a new facet was detected by the presence of a blinking gear icon in the statusbar:

If you click on the 'More...' link (or on the blinking gear icon), you'll get a screen that looks like this:

Click 'Edit Settings...' to make sure that the correct ivy.xml file is chosen for each module. _Note: there is a known issue that the ivy file displayed here may differ from the one that is configured in the module settings, so make sure to check this if your module contains multiple ivy.xml files!_
